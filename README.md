# ltto - the project

An experimental web application for a private business which focuses on multi-prices for the same product. The app is purely implemented by Angular 4 and uses Firebase as a data storage.


### Dependencies

The implementation of this app is built on top of the followings:

* [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) – material component for Angular
* [Plotly.js](https://plot.ly/plotly-js-scientific-d3-charting-library/) – charting library built on [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
* [AngularFire2](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2) – library for Firebase and Angular


## Responsiveness

Since the main focus of the app is the mobility, all available pages must be serve all device screen sizes.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      <img src="example/media/dashboard-tablet.png" width="450"/>
    </th>
    <th>
      <img src="example/media/dashboard-phone.png" width="220"/>
    </th>
  </tr>
</table>

## Authentication

The app uses the authentication process provided by Firebase.
